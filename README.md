# Rust Timer App

This is a simple timer app written in Rust that allows you to set a duration and then counts down until the timer is completed.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Rust installed on your machine in order to run this app. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

## Usage
To use the timer app, simply run the following command in your terminal:
`cargo run`

You will be prompted to enter the duration of the timer in seconds. Once you enter the duration, the app will start the timer and count down until it is completed.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the timer app:
